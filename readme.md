## What is One1?
One1 is a matching game. Integer values are to be matched with their corresponding string values. For instance '1', and 'one.' To play simply identify an integer within the 4x4 grid and click it, followed by it's corresponding string. Or vice versa. Should your time expire, or no more pairs can be matched, your score will be evaluated and displayed
## Where to play it?
The game should operate fine within any browser(as of 30/08/2021), simply `clone` the repo and utilise vscode's live server extension. Alternatively, (provided [repl.it](https://replit.com) doesn't cease to exist) the game may be played [here](https://Hirakata-One1.b3stg1rlm1sh4.repl.co)
